title: "Digital Scholarship: An Introduction"
---

## Outline

This 90 minute workshop will introduce popular tools and some conceptual approaches to digital scholarship. The end product will be a static webpage, a place that you can use to communicate and disseminate your scholarly outputs.

This is a low barrier workshop ideal for those interested in digital workflows that will stand the test of time, reflect best practices in document structure, and leverage version control for both recovery and transparency.

We will start by going mouse free, using the command line interface to navigate our computer. We will then learn the basics of Markdown, an alternative to using Microsoft Word to build beautiful looking documents that are grounded in plain text. Lastly, we will publish our Markdown document to the web using GitHub and GitHub Pages.

This is an introductory level workshop that will set the stage for further exploration into navigating and exploring the files on your computer (or on a remote server), authoring documents in flexible, persistent formats, and sharing your outputs wether for an academic CV, conference poster session, or just for fun.

## Objectives

* Introduce students to a set of computational tools used in academia for research and scholarly communication.
* Emphasize the role of these tools in transparency and reproducibility
* Explore approaches to solving issues related to research and scholarly communication that leverage computational approaches that simplify repetitive tasks

## Outcomes

* Navigate a file system with the command line
* Author a basic document with Markdown syntax
* Understand the role of plain text authoring in the context of research and scholarly communication
* Publish a Markdown document to the web using GitHub Pages

## What you will need

* A computer. Neither a tablet nor cell phone will suffice. That's it. We'll set you up with everything else during the workshop.
