Now that we have a Markdown file with information to share, we need an inexpensive and reliable place to publish it. [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a free and widely trusted online platform that can be used to store files and folders, to edit and track changes to the files, and to publish simple websites from Markdown content.

## Git and version control
GitHub is designed for sharing _Git repositories_, collections of files that are tracked using version control software called Git. You don't need to install or learn Git to publish files on GitHub, but it's helpful to know that the structure, terminology, and workflows in GitHub are derived from Git.

Git is open source software that tracks changes made to a group of files. Each group of tracked files is called a _repository_. Git takes periodic snapshots of the files and stores them as a _version_ of the repository, keeping track of all previous versions and documenting the changes, when they were made, and by whom.

It takes some discipline to learn and make use of version control but there are many benefits:

* **Collaboration** - Version control helps teams work collaboratively on same set of documents without interfering with each other.
* **Versioning** - It provides a thorough log of changes to tracked files without creating multiple copies, making it easier to identify the most current version.
* **Rolling back** - Made a mistake?  Version control lets you review and undo changes, reverting to previous stages in the document's history. This can be useful when changes to your files introduce unforeseen problems.
* **Backup** - While not intended primarily as a backup solution, version control systems make it easy to keep syncronized copies of your files in multiple locations.

## GitHub for publishing
GitHub is a website for hosting and sharing Git repositories. It is designed to _complement_ a local installation of Git software, but it can also be used on its own in a web browser. In this workshop we will use GitHub only, but for larger projects you may wish to install Git. Integrating GitHub with Git allows you to edit files on your own computer with your preferred text editing tools, then periodically synchronize them with a copy of the repository in GitHub.


### Create a repository

1. Sign in to [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. In the top right corner, click the _+_ icon and select _New Repository_
3. On the _Create a new repository_ page
	- give your repository a name and optional description
	- leave it as _Public_ (this is required to publish a webpage)
	- select _Add a README file_
	- click _Create repository_


Though not mandatory, choosing a license is an important part of openly sharing your creative work online. For help selecting an appropriate license see <https://choosealicense.com/>.

### Upload a text file to the repository

Git was designed for _text_ files that can be opened in a text editor (as opposed to _binary_ file formats like .pdf and .docx).  A Git repository can preserve files of any type, but only text files will benefit from all Git's features.  

Upload the Markdown file you created earlier to your new repository.

### Pubish the file with GitHub Pages
