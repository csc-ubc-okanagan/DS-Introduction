# Git and GitHub
We will use GitHub to publish the webpage file so anyone who scans the QR code on our poster can access it online. Though we're only using GitHub for publishing, its main purpose is for version control and collaboration.  

## Concepts and definitions

### What is version control?

Git is version control software that tracks the changes made to a group of files. Version control systems are often associated with software development but are increasingly used for collaboration in research and academic environments. 

It takes some discipline to learn and make use of version control but there are many benefits:

* **Collaboration** - Version control helps teams work collaboratively on same set of documents without interfering with each other.
* **Versioning** - It provides a thorough log of changes to tracked files without creating multiple copies, making it easier to identify the most current version.
* **Rolling back** - Made a mistake?  Version control lets you review and undo changes, reverting to previous stages in the document's history. This can be useful when changes to your files introduce unforeseen problems.
* **Backup** - While not meant to be a backup solution, version control systems mean your code and writing can be stored on multiple computers.

### What are Git and GitHub?

**_Git_** and **_GitHub_** are often used interchangeably but it's important to understand what each does and how they work together.

**_Git_** is a free, open source tool that can be installed on your local computer to track changes made to a set of files (referred to as a "git repository" or "repo"). Git can be used independently to organize one's own work, or to coordinate team projects with multiple authors. Git ensures that everyone's contributions are tracked and merged effectively by keeping copies of all previous versions and documenting the changes, when they were made, and by whom.   

Git was designed for _text_ files that can be opened in a text editor (as opposed to _binary_ file formats like .pdf and .docx).  A Git repository can preserve files of any type, but only text files will benefit from all Git's features.

**_GitHub_** is a popular website for hosting and sharing Git repositories. GitHub provides online infrastructure that makes it easier for teams to collaborate with Git.  Team members make contributions to the repository on local copies of the files, then "push" their changes back to GitHub so everyone else can see them.  

The GitHub interface makes it easy to view files in the repository and what changes have been made. GitHub also makes it easier for groups to publish their work (each GitHub repository can have its own project website, blog, and wiki using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).)

The names Git and GitHub are sometimes used interchangeably but they are actually different pieces of software that often work together. 

## Publishing with GitHub 

A collection of files and folders tracked by Git and / or stored on GitHub is referred to as a "repository," sometimes shorted to "repo". In today's workshop we will create a repository in GitHub containing our web file, then use the GitHub Pages feature to publish the repository's contents as a simple stand-alone website.

Using GitHub in this way allows you to create simple websites at no cost.

### Create an empty GitHub repository

Log into your GitHub account and create a new repository by clicking the **+** icon in the upper-right corner of
any page, then selecting **New repository**.  

__Placeholder for screenshot__

- Name the repository
- Add optional description
- Ensure repository is set to "Public"
- Click "Create repository"

Though not mandatory, choosing a license is an important part of openly sharing your creative work online. For help selecting an appropriate license see <https://choosealicense.com/>.
